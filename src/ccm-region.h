/*
 * The functions in this file implement the Region abstraction, similar to one
 * used in the X11 sample server. A Region is simply an area, as the name
 * implies, and is implemented as a "y-x-banded" array of rectangles. To
 * explain: Each Region is made up of a certain number of rectangles sorted
 * by y coordinate first, and then by x coordinate.
 *
 * Furthermore, the rectangles are banded such that every rectangle with a
 * given upper-left y coordinate (y1) will have the same lower-right y
 * coordinate (y2) and vice versa. If a rectangle has scanlines in a band, it
 * will span the entire vertical distance of the band. This means that some
 * areas that could be merged into a taller rectangle will be represented as
 * several shorter rectangles to account for shorter rectangles to its left
 * or right but within its "vertical scope".
 *
 * An added constraint on the rectangles is that they must cover as much
 * horizontal area as possible. E.g. no two rectangles in a band are allowed
 * to touch.
 *
 * Whenever possible, bands will be merged together to cover a greater vertical
 * distance (and thus reduce the number of rectangles). Two bands can be merged
 * only if the bottom of one touches the top of the other and they have
 * rectangles in the same places (of the same width, of course). This maintains
 * the y-x-banding that's so nice to have...
